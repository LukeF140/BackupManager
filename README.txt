BACKUP MANAGER
Created by Luke Fairs

This program will backup all the directorys to a defined location

This program gets the directorys and locations from the file 'BackupLocs.txt'
This file should be organised into pairs like stated.
	The first line of the pair should be the directory to be backed up:
		eg. C:\Users\ExampleUser\Pictures
	The second line of the pair should be the location where the backup file should be placed:
    		eg. C:\Backups

The program will then create your backup when ever ran

The backup will be a .zip folder using the following name covention:
	nameoffolder_BACKUP--DD-MM-YYYY_HH-MM.zip

This program is still under development and will change overtime as new features and systems are implemented.
